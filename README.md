## Course Description

Looking to add dynamic content, third-party data, or animation to your websites and apps? In this course, Joe Marini introduces jQuery, an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the process of adding advanced functionality to web projects. Joe shows you how to use the features of jQuery to achieve many common web development patterns, as well as how to use built-in browser equivalents when they make more sense. Check out this course to gain a comprehensive understanding of the jQuery libraryâ€”when to use it and when not to, and how to approach migration projects when updating code that contains some of the more outdated features of the library.
